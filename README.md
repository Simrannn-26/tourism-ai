# AI Tourism Exploration Website – Explore India Smartly

The AI Tourism Exploration Website is an application-based platform developed to provide a unified and intelligent tourism exploration experience focused on India. The system is designed to help users discover destinations, cultural highlights, tourist attractions, local cuisine, and travel insights through a clean interface and an interactive India map.

Unlike traditional travel platforms that focus mainly on bookings or reviews, this project emphasizes exploration and decision support. It integrates AI-driven insights to generate personalized travel guidance, including suggested itineraries, distance and route information, local transport options, and estimated travel budgets covering accommodation, food, transportation, and activities.

The platform also incorporates contextual features such as AQI awareness for environmentally informed travel and translation support to assist communication for non-local and international tourists. By centralizing essential travel information into a single intelligent dashboard, the system enhances trip planning efficiency and user experience.

Developed using modern web technologies and API integrations, this project falls under the domain of Artificial Intelligence and Web Development and is categorized as an application-based system aimed at promoting smart, accessible, and insight-driven tourism across India.
